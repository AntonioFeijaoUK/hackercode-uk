Hi and welcome to [HackerCode.UK](https://hackercode.uk). Still to decided what to do in here, but the term `hacker` here
is refered as the `good hacker` or `white hacker`.

> White hats are hackers who work to keep data safe from other hackers by finding system vulnerabilities that can be mitigated.
> White hats are usually employed by the target system's owner and are typically paid (sometimes quite well) for their work.
> Their work is not illegal because it is done with the system owner's consent.
